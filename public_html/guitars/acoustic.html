<h2>Acoustic Guitars</h2>
<p>Acoustic guitars are much more melodic and calm than electric guitars.  They are very versatile, and produce their sounds from the guitar itself.  In the middle of the body of the guitar, there is a sound hole, where the vibrations from the strings are amplified and given a full sound.  You can also purchase acoustic guitars which have pickups in the sound holes, in order to play through speakers or to amplify the sound even more.  Acoustic guitars are often what people use when they are first learning how to play the guitar.

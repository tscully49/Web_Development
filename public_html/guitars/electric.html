<h2>Electric Guitars</h2>
<p>If you play an electric guitar, the chances are, you enjoy rock and roll.  Although electric guitars can be used for many different styles of music, the most popular form of music played by an electric guitar, is rock.  Electric guitars produce their sound from pickups near the body of the guitar, placed at different locations, which pick up on the vibrations of the strings.  The signal from those pickups are then amplified and output through a speaker.  Often times, people use sound effects on their electric guitars to change the sounds, whether it is distortion, overdrive, reverb, or even delay.  Electric guitars can also be easier to play than acoustic since the strings are much lighter and more flexible.  </p>
